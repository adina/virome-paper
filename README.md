virome-paper
============

Scripts used in our virome paper.  In general, here was the strategy.

Extract DNA from experiment (3 fractions - VLP, IND, TOTAL)
Assemble each of the fractions separately
Dereplicate contigs that were 97% similar
Map all reads from all samples to final combined assembly
Create abundance matrix based on mapping
To ensure best quality, filter by only contigs for which there is known annotation (recognizing that this is only 20% of our data)
Look for drivers of change (statistical significance)
Publish our findings!

Includes:
* Information on Sample IDs and sequencing file IDs
* Parameters and programs used for quality trimming, read merging, pre-assembly dgital normalization, assembly, and read mapping 
* Files for analysis in R and scripts used for analysis presented in paper
